Hi, I’m @kjmkeane.

I’m interested in poetry and poetics. 

As an aid to my research, I am currently learning “Python Basics for Data Science” on ‘edX’.

If you are exploring how Python can further research into poetry and should like to exchange thoughts and ideas, I can be reached via kevinkeane@mac.com
